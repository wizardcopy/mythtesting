## Setup Guide
1. Create a new Unity project (I recommend Unity 2021.3 or later)
2. Open the Package Manager window (Window > Package Manager)
3. In the top bar, Change "Packages: In Project" for "Packages: Unity Registry"
4. Download & Install "Input System" from the package list (this will restart the editor)
5. Go back to the Package Manager window again
6. In the top bar, Change "Packages: Unity Registry" for "My Assets"
7. Download & Install Mythril2D
8. Your project settings will be overwriten and Unity may need to restart

## Script Reference
You can find more information about Mythril2D components and how to use them by reading our editor built-in documentation accessible from Unity's menu bar: `Window > Mythril2D > Tutorials`.
