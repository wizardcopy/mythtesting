  - Thanks again for getting rid of this necromancer! Now that this threat is gone,
    I can focus on building our town's wealth again.
  - Speaking of, Yosbar the blacksmith still hasn't paid his taxes yet, I could use
    a little convincing from a strong character like you.
  - Would you mind visiting Yosbar and get this money from him? Don't worry, he is
    well off.
