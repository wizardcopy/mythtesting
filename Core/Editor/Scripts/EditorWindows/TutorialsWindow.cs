These assets can be reused and supplemented with additional ones in the same art style, which can be found on the authors' websites (refer to the LICENSE documents for each third-party asset used in the demo game).",
            "<b>Advanced mode:</b> For more experienced users working on medium-sized game productions, you can kick-start your game production by using the demo game as a foundation and replacing the assets with your own. Keep in mind that RPG games require a large number of assets, including sprites, animations, music, and sound effects.",
            "<b>Expert mode:</b> If you're an expert user with a strong understanding of Mythril2D and working on larger game productions, you can start building your game from scratch using the core building blocks provided by the toolkit. This approach requires deep knowledge of Mythril2D and significant expertise in game development and design.",
            "<b>Ready to get started?</b>\nTo begin, I recommend exploring the available tutorials as well as the demo game. The demo game is an excellent resource for gaining a better understanding of how Mythril2D can be used to create unique RPG games. Take a closer look at the demo characters, abilities, maps, and other assets to see how they can be adapted and customized to suit your own vision and game design. With persistence and practice, you can master the tools and features of Mythril2D and create the game you've been dreaming of.",

The DatabaseRegistry is automatically updated when you create or delete a DatabaseEntry, ensuring that your database is always up to date.

To make your Gameplay scene more fun, read more about maps!",

It typically consists of level design elements, such as decorations, gameplay components, characters, and music. Maps are where you'll spend most of your time creating, in contrast to the Gameplay scene, which will mostly remain unchanged. A map can be loaded from the SaveSystem (see Game Systems) when a save file is loaded, or by a Teleporter (see Teleporters) when the player interacts with it (e.g., by entering a house).",
            "<b>Playtesting your maps</b>\nAs mentioned earlier, only the Main Menu and Gameplay scenes are actual standalone scenes. Your maps should always be used as a layer on top of the Gameplay scene. This means that by default, you cannot hit play while editing your map to test it. However, by adding a PlaytestManager (see the PlaytestManager prefab in the demo project) to your map, you can ask Mythril2D to load the Gameplay scene whenever you hit play! This makes iterating on a map much faster, without having to switch back and forth between the Gameplay scene and your map. The PlaytestManager also allows you to create scenarios with unique save files, so you can playtest your map with different parameters (e.g., different characters, items, quests, or game flags).",

If only one option is set, the provided DialogueSequence will automatically play following the current sequence. This is very convenient when working with branching conversations, as multiple sequences can converge to the same sequence. If more than one option is available to the player, you can name these options by filling in the first text field. Finally, the dropdown at the end of the option line allows you to add specific strings to the message feed, which will be explained later.",

Some scripts may play a dialogue sequence and read the message feed at the end of its execution. Each option can add one string to the message feed. For instance, a dialogue sequence used to initiate a quest is expected to contain \"Accept\" or \"Decline\", meaning that your sequence should probably include these options somewhere. The Demo game's quest dialogues offer great examples of using the message feed. You can also populate the message feed with custom strings and retrieve and parse these strings in a script. This can be useful for advanced users who want to expand Mythril2D by creating custom scripts.

An AudioChannel defines how sounds can be played, with the exclusive mode allowing for one sound at a time, and the multiple mode allowing for the playback of multiple sounds in parallel. Each AudioChannel has its own AudioSource, allowing you to set different settings, such as volume and pitch, for each channel.

The purpose of using multiple tilemaps is to visually represent depth in the environment. For instance, you may want a mushroom tile (with a transparent background) to be displayed on top of a grass tile, so placing the grass tile on Layer A and the mushroom tile on Layer B would be a good idea. It's up to you to decide what goes into each layer, as well as how many layers you want to use. The player is rendered in the Default sorting layer, so the depth resolution between any tile in the Default layer and the player will be based on the Y coordinate of these elements. Therefore, for any tile that the player can walk behind (such as a tree, a big rock, a fence, or a house), it would make sense to place this tile on the Default layer and let Unity resolve the sorting order by comparing the Y coordinate of the tile and the player."
